# Theatrical Box Office Prediction

Welcome to the Theatrical Box Office Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the total gross of theatrical movies using a combination of Python, SQL, web scraping, linear regression, and Excel techniques. The data for this project has been gathered from Kaggle.

## Overview
The theatrical box office prediction project utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the total gross of movies released in theaters. By combining data from multiple sources and applying predictive modeling, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing movie box office performance.

## Key Components
- **Python**: Python programming language is used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models.
- **SQL**: SQL queries are employed for data extraction, transformation, and analysis from the database.
- **Web Scraping**: Web scraping techniques are utilized to gather additional data from relevant online sources to enrich the dataset.
- **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is employed as the predictive modeling technique to forecast the total gross of theatrical movies.
- **Excel**: Excel is used for analysis, and reporting, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring the dataset and model outputs.
